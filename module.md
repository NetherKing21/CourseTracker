# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name:

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |       X       |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:
- You must create a database for your program to use including at least one table to store data into.

- Your software must demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (or query) data.

- This module requires more than just creating the database and determining SQL commands. You must write software that builds the SQL commands, submits them, receives the results from the database, and uses the results in some way.

Stretch Requirements (Pick one of the following):
- Add additional tables to your database and perform a join in your software between two of the tables.

- Use at least two of the aggregate functions to summarize numerical data in your database.

- Demonstrate the use of a column containing a date or time along with a query that demonstrates filtering within a date or time range.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
- [W3 Schools for MySQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
- [Tutorials Point for SQLite](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/index.htm)

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
- Start by making a SQLite database and practice using/manipulating that
    - First make something simple (two tables, probably make a copy of something premade)
    - Make new database but I put the information into it (maybe something for player profiles for DnD example one table for each individule player and their stats another for all the items in their inventory)
    - Try and make a gui for it to make it pretty
- If things go well, I might move it to a MySQL sever and trying that

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
- Software where you make a character it gets saved in a database, and you change change and manipulate it and it can compute your ability modifiers

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
- Tuesday, 1pm to 3pm, uppper lounge of the apparment
- Thrusday, 7:30am to 9:30am in my apartment
- Saturdat, 8:30 to 9:30am in the STC

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you anticipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitigation plan?
- The two main risks for this project is that I don't keep it simple enough and that I can't figure out the GUI for tkinter. My mitigation plan is to keep it simple by doing often reality checks. Ask myself is this nessiary. As for the GUI, I plan on making a simple command line version first and if I can't figure the GUI out in time I will exspand on the command line.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.
