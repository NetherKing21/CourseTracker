**Project Goals**:Create a simple terminal Course planner using a SQLite Relational Database to store the information

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Python 3
2. Install SQLite [here](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)

Instructions for using the software:

1. Download the ComputerScienceCoursesTaken.db and courseTracker.py (Make sure they are in the same folder)
2. Run courseTracker.py from terminal
3. Follow prompts for correct use

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Beautiful Tutorial](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/)
* [SQLite Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/index.htm)
* [Sample SQLite Database](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Clean up terminal by adding os.system('CLS') functions
* [ ] Rename database (it's too long and wouldn't be accurate if I added more courses) and fix code for the new name
* [ ] Add webscraping capabilities to add more courses
